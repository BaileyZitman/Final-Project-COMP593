1. **Date:** 2021- 03 - 17 **Time Logged:** 1 **Description:** The assignment was assigned today and to get prepared I started by creating a new repository called "Final- Project-COMP593". I also downloaded Github Broswer and configured Github to be paired with VSCode (my default editor) using a token to enable working on the repo from my host computer. This alows me to push and merge changes made on my local machine to the repository. I also created this History file which will serve as a work log throughout the project. It uses markdown formatting and i first attempted to create a table but the formatting was accoplishing the desired outcome. This was identified in my first test commit (to see if i could merge and if the formatting was desirable) and as such I have update the formatting of the "History.md" to not be formatted into a table but a list. The inportant headers are shown in **bold** text. Made a second commit to test the second attempt at formating. The formatting is acceptable.
