| 1 | 2021- 03 - 17 | 1 | The assignment was assigned today and to get prepared I started by creating a new repository called "Final- Project-COMP593". I also downloaded Github Broswer and configured Github to be paired with VSCode (my default editor) using a token to enable working on the repo from my host computer. I created this History file next. It uses markdown formatting and arranges everything into a pretty table |
