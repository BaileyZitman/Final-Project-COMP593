Each entry (number in the list) represents a different session. For each session the date is provided, the amount of time logged for that session is provided and a description of the activities completed/worked on is provided. 

**Note:** Date is presented in the format YYYY-MM-DD
**Note:** Time Logged is measured to the quarter hour and expressed in hours

1. **Date:** 2021- 03 - 17 **Time Logged:** 2 **Description:** The assignment was assigned today and to get prepared I started by creating a new repository called "Final- Project-COMP593". I also downloaded Github Broswer and configured Github to be paired with VSCode (my default editor) using a token to enable working on the repo from my host computer. This alows me to push, pull, and merge (etc...) changes made on my local machine to the repository. I also created this History file which will serve as a working log throughout the project. It uses markdown formatting and i first attempted to create a table but the formatting was not accomplishing the desired outcome. This was identified in my first test commit (to see if i could merge and if the formatting was desirable) and as such I have update the formatting of the "History.md" to not be formatted into a table but a list. The inportant headers are shown in **bold** text. Made a second commit to test the second attempt at formating. The formatting is acceptable. made a few modifications regarding the README.md file but it still needs to be updated down the line with functionality constraits, and any info the user could use to better utlize the script. Took a break but didnt commit changes at this time. See next session.
   
2. **Date:** 2021- 03 - 17 **Time Logged:** 2 **Description:** Started again a few hours later. Started building the python script by producing a ***header*** and testing the connection. Thankfully my Mars Rover Script came in handy (not the test tho :/ ) and the connection was easy (already had a dev key and base, base code to work off of). I tested manipulating the data and got it to print the data i wanted to the command prompt. started the part of the script that builds the database. RIGHT NOW (may change) the database if called PBMZ-db-FP.db. Attempted to create a table and got an syntax error amd sqlite execution error (caused by same thing presumably). I was correct. Firgured it out by mistake when reformatting the primary key which turns out needed to be reformatted anyways. A table has now been created in the database mentioned above called "Astronomy Image of The Day" (this will be the only table in the database). Played around with adding data to the table. had issues with unsupported type. put down for the night. I committed my changed to the ***Testing*** branch. Note: If looking through history (Github history) the python file is only in a test phase and not complete. It includes lots of testing ***errors*** (not actual errors).
